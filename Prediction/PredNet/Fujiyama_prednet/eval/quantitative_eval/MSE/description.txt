% MSE.py
	This program calculates the average of MSE between 2 frames in a row.
	(scale: RGB value / 255)
	
	Usage:
		python MSE.py <arg0> <arg1> <arg2> â€¦
	Arguments:
		-d <image list>
		-b <beginning id> (0 <= b < #row(image list))
		-e <end id> (b < e <= #row(image list))
     		-r <root directory>
     		-c <# channels> (RGB => 3, gray scale => 1 )
     		-s <size of each image> (width,height (pixels))


% MSE_Lv1_seq.py
	This program is for comparison between (input, correct) and
	(predict, correct) in a specific sequence.
	If (input, correct) > (predict, correct), then the learned model
	can generate better predictive frames rather than reconstructing
	the last input frames.

	This calculates and outputs the average of MSE at (input, correct)
	and (predict, correct). (scale: RGB value / 255)
	
	Usage:
		python MSE_Lv1_seq.py <arg0> <arg1> <arg2> ...
	Arguments:
     		-d <sequence name>
     		-r <sequence range>
     		-p <image directory path>
     		-c <# channels> (RGB => 3, gray scale => 1 )
     		-s <size of each image> (width,height (pixels))

% MSE_Lv2_seq.py
	This program is for comparison between (input, predict) and
	(predict, correct) in a specific sequence.
	If (input, predict) > (predict, correct), then the learned model
	can generate predictive frames which are closer to the correct frames
	than to the last input frames.
	
	This calculates and outputs the average of MSE at (input, predict)
	and (predict, correct). (scale: RGB value / 255)
